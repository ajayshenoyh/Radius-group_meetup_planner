# Ionic 3 Group event planner

A group event planner application made using Ionic 3 and firebase.

# Problem Statement
We have always seen people debating about selecting a place where they can go to hang out with their friends and spend some time with them. As a person who likes meeting friends, talking to them about life events or maybe playing a table game while having a cup of coffee or a plate of Mediterranean food, it has always been hard to pick the right place that can be convenient to the people whom I want to meet and me. There are technologies available that are limited for such an experience. For example, using Yelp, you can only share a location with a person and ask him/her to be at the place at a specific time. But, there are limitations to this. You can use it to share only one location at a time with just one person. Also, there isnâ€™t any logic behind the selected place.
In addition to these limitations, being able to create a group where a user can add people whom he/she wants to meet can be very helpful. Having such a feature will help the group decide on places/restaurants nearby based on the proximity from each of the group members and provides interactive chat rooms for a particular group where each can post their opinion/views.
